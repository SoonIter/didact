In addition to the [walkthrough](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/), this repository refactors the code into separate files of TypeScript code and adds the following features:
- `useEffect` hook
- `useMemo` hook
- `useCallback` hook
- `useRef` hook
- Support for passing an object to `style` prop
